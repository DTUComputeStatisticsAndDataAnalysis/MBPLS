"""
Multi-Block Partial Least Squares (MB-PLS) for Python
=====================================================

The mbpls package contains three multi-block capable algorithms, i.e. KERNEL, NIPALS and UNIPALS, as
well as SIMPLS for fast predictions.

The aim of the package is to provide a unified interface and easy access to these algorithms.
