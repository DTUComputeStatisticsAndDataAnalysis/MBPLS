- NIPALS and SIMPLS PLS algorithms versus Scikit Learn PLS result
- MBPLS implementation as described in Bougeard et al 2011
- MBPLS works for univariate and multivariate Y

TODO
- MBPLS algorithm yet needs to be tested and benchmarked versus R package Ade4 mbpls.r function
- MBPLS algorithm needs to be optimized for the case of p >> n (using SVD(XX'YY') as described in Lindgreen et al 1998)
